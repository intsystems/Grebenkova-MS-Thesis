# Abstract

Focal cortical dysplasia (FCD) is one of the most common brain lesions that cause epilepsy, and it is usually diagnosed by a radiologist inspecting an MRI scan of the patientâ€™s brain. Surgical resection can result in reduced need for anti-epileptic medication, reduced frequency or most commonly complete absence of seizures. The purpose of the project is to create a reliable system for the doctor to detect structural changes in the cerebral cortex based on MRI data. This work focuses on deep learning part of the pipeline. We suppose to use Minkowski Engine for the point cloud representation of brains. The resulted method will be applied to the dataset of 202 labeled
FCD patients collected in a collaboration with medical partners and compared with the state-of-the-art approaches for FCD detection.
